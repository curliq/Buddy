# Buddy app

Notes:
- First time using MVVM instead of MVP, according to the pattern's design, the ViewModel is only a bridge between the view and the Model, and the state should be held by the model - however I've omitted the Model and kept the state in the ViewModel as I didn't see any benefits to compensate the extra layer
